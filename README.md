# Remote-control-of-astronomical-telescopes
This project aims to make it convenient for all astronomy enthusiasts to observe real-time astronomical phenomena around the world anytime and anywhere.
What we have done:
1. A systematic queuing procedure was written to ensure that only one user was using the telescope.
2. A test telescope (seastar) has been purchased.
3. The control program is complete.

What we will do next:
1. Complete internal testing of the program to ensure that the control program can allow the telescope to complete the star search.
2. Write a website that is open to users.

Late optimization direction:
1. Embedded GPT model: create an AI robot that can answer various astronomical knowledge and help answer astronomical knowledge while the user is waiting in line.
2. Provide a live stream that can be observed in real-time, so that users in line can watch the phenomenon observed by users who are using the telescope.
